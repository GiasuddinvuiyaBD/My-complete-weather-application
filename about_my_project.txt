Assalamu alaikum everyone,
	 Today i have completed weather application project.

I would like to wirte something about my today project. At first i used html for making markup of my object then i have added some css form makin it looks like an weather application. 

Form now i will talk about JavaScript.
In JavaScript i have taken three big step
1. UI Part
2. Data layer 
3. localStorage part 

Now i want to explain my application`s this three parts. 
In the first part of our application i have worked for UI. Now i am going to talk about UI part .
At first i have making an object call UI inside of the object i taken several type of function that function will work single respectivility it means one function will work for one thing. 

In the UI object at first i have taken funciton call "selectAllElm()" inside this function i selected all the html elment that i need to use for our application not only for that but also i have taken more function such as validate(),getInputValue(),setInputToUi(),resetError(country,city) and showErrorMsg(country,city) so this time of function i have taken for working specificlly. In this way i have completely finished UI part.


In the second part of our application i have worked for Data layer. At firt have taken an object call "weatherData". Inside the object i have taken a three object 
like this : 
	country : '',
	city : '',
	API_KEY : 'bb459a9b116eee77f3b727de61f3a4b5',
And then i am taking a function call getWeather(). Inside the function i have worked with API not onely i worked just api but also i working with asynchronous function and promise. So this way i am also complete part-2


In section three i seted data in localStorage and show it to  UI.

Now i would like to talk something about localStorage. I fist i have taken an object call "localStoragesData". Inside the object i have teken two function *(getItem() and saveItem()) one for getting data form user and one for setting data to localStorage. Useing this function for completing localStorage part. After working with this function i have completely solve localStoring part
